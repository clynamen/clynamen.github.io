<div style="display:inline;">I am a <script type="text/javascript">

var d1=new Date(1993, 1, 1);
var d2=new Date();

var milli=d2-d1;
var milliPerYear=1000*60*60*24*365.26;

var yearsApart=milli/milliPerYear;

I usually write code in Java and C#, both for fun and at work as a server developer. Lately however I spend more time with functional languages, especially scala. 
I also love C++ and other languages with powerful metaprogramming support.
