</script> 
years old student of Mechatronic Engineering at Polytechnic University of Turin, where I received a bachelor degree in Computer Engineering in 2015. I am about to complete my Master's degree in Mechatronic Engineering</div> <div></div>

My main interests are related to **robotics**, **machine learning**, and **infosec**. 

I work at [Objective Software](http://objective.de/), an IT company specialized in automotive development with a strong focus on Autonomous Driving, where I am currently involved in both production and research activities. 

Every field of computer science is interesting to me, thus I often jump back and forth between low-level stuff and high-level novelties. Currently, I am more focused on Deep Learning due to the surprising results achieved every day by the community. And the math behind machine learning in general is awesome. 

My language of choice is **modern C++**, **python** is my swiss army knife. But I love to try new languages, specially the functional ones.

The name of the blog comes from **Serial Experiments Lain**, which had a huge influence on me when I was a child, introducing me into Art. Since then, I liked slow-paced movies (Antonioni, Tarkovsky, Kubrick, S. Coppola). 

I listen to Math Rock and downtempo electronic music.

<!--I started programming in C++ and C# during high school, developing simple desktop apps (using Qt) and joining a [game development team](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=93007501) (which I later left in order to start my first job). After some experience in server development (Java, C# and python) I am now focused in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. -->
<!--Along with many engineers from my university I currently work on the SLAM system of an engineering model of a rover built by [team DIANA](http://www.teamdiana.org/).-->

<!--I usually write code in C++ and python. Lately however I spend more time with functional languages like scala and haskell.  -->
