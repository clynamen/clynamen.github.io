mechatronic engineer at Luxoft, where I work as a software engineer in the [autonomous driving division](https://www.luxoft.com/automotive/#autonomous-drive).</div> <div></div>

My main interests are related to **robotics**, **machine learning**, and **infosec**. 

Every field of computer science is interesting to me, thus I often jump back and forth between low-level stuff and high-level novelties.

My language of choice is **modern C++**, **python** is my swiss army knife. But I love to try new languages, specially the functional ones. I hope to work consistently with **rust** in the near future. 

The name of the blog comes from **Serial Experiments Lain**. 

I listen to Math Rock and downtempo electronic music.
